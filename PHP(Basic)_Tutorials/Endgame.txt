------Story of Avengers : Endgame ------		
<br/>
<br/>
Marvel Studios released the first new teaser of Avengers 4 today, 
and also revealing the name of the movie as Avengers : End Game.<br/>
So it starts with Tony recording using his armor to send message to Potts if he dies in space. 
A spaceship is seen floating in space as he mentions he is running out of supplies and oxygen.<br/> 
In the end of Avengers Infinity War he was left alone in Titan with Nebula,<br/> 
and we do not see Nebula here with him but seems like he managed to build a spaceship and tries to travel his way back.<br/>
<br/>
Next they show Thanos walking in his farm with his damaged gauntlet with Natasha mentioning that Thanos won the game by erasing 50% of the earth&#39;s population.<br/> 
We get to see a clean shaved Cap, while he let off his tears for the loss.<br/> 
Bruce Banner looks into the hologram which has Scott Lang on one side and on the other has Peter Parker and Shuri, which confirms that Shuri did not survive the snap.<br/>
<br/>
Captain voice over mentions about the loss that everyone has faced,
and the teaser introduces a pissed of Thor (may be he is still thinking why he didn&#39;t go for the head) sitting in a confined space,<br/> 
and guilt filled Nebula who looks at something which I assume should be Tony in the space ship he built.<br/> 
<br/>
After this we get to see the Hawkeye who was missing in the Infinity war, 
now in the form of Ronin who is wielding his samurai sword in Japan with Natasha watching him in surprise.<br/> 
May be this is the place where the whole world changed or a new dimension where he is the Ronin.
This goes with Captain looking into his pocket watch with his lady love&#39;s pic,<br/> 
the same he looks into while he crashes the plane into the glacier in First Avenger (Is this a indication that he would die in this movie just like First Avenger?)<br/> 
Natasha and Steve share a conversation which is my favorite part in the teaser.<br/> 
<br>
After which the logo and name of the movie is revealed and the logo is animated like the ashes coming back and fitting in.
Post teaser scenes reveal Scott shouting to open the door,<br/>
while Steve and Nat see the video message and confirm that it is an old message which was recorded sometime in the past.<br/> 
Behind Scott stands the van which has the quantum reactor which we saw in Ant-man and the Wasp movie.<br/> 
So he some how made it out of the quantum realm and figured out that he need to bring in everyone to fight Thanos and reverse the snap.<br/>
It is very clear that Ant-man has a very critical part to play in the movie and as expected we did not see any frame of Captain Marvel in the teaser.
